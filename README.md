# **Netflix Recommendation System**

In this project, I built a movie recommendation system using machine learning to suggest Netflix-style movies to users based on their preferences. The dataset included movies released between 1916 and 2020. I used content-based filtering techniques to recommend similar movies based on genres, keywords, and other features. This project helped me understand how recommendation systems work behind the scenes and how they improve user experience on platforms like Netflix.
